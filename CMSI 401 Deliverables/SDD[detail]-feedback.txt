Architectural Design Section:
-----------------------------
Another great effort on this deliverable!

Your description is, of course, excellent.  I love the screen views at the
start which show the coders a lot of detail of what is intended.  Your other
diagrams at the end are also VERY useful.  Good for you for finding out how
to do UML diagrams!  They look great.  You have handled the "manager" and
"sequencer" parts very well.

Another outstanding document from Team Triumverate!!  EXCELLENT!!

Detailed Design Section:
------------------------
Wow, another awesome work product from the team!  Your amount of detail is
amazing and you have SO MANY parts to this project.  You've done a most
admirable job of documenting EVERYTHING, and with this much to document,
I've seen SO many teams [student AND professional] who will elide things
from the design just to get through it.  You guys have the perseverence
you need to be great software engineers!

NICE JOB!
