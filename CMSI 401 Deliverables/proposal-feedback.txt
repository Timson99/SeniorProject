CMSI 401 project ~~ Fall 2020
Luis Garcia, Timothy Herrmann, Joe Maiocco
Cosmonarium game project
=================================
Presentation:
   well-done presentation, professional yet fun and engaging.  the graphics
   are great and add a nice dimension to the slides.  good idea specifying a
   year-long project for something of this magnitude with only a three-person
   development team.  also nice that you are using a technology that is in
   the research and design phase, so that you are cutting-edge.  however, be
   aware that with such a situation comes the risk that something will change
   with that tech during your project implementation that may not be entirely
   compatible with what you have developed, essentially breaking everything
   [it has happened during 401 projects more than once!].  Be sure to allow
   some schedule "slippage" time!

Proposal Document:
   great work on the document, too.  you have captured everything quite nicely
   and have given a good rationale for the project, the use of your knowledge,
   and the top-level goals of the development.  very nice!

=============================================================================
Excellent work on this presentation and proposal!

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus
