Great work here, guys, as usual....

Waterfall also has a "deployment" phase which you don't mention.  Sometimes
that is lumped in with the "maintenance" phase, but in most cases it should
NOT be.  Maintenance alone accounts for an average of 70% to 80% of total
cost of a software project, so anything that can be taken separately will
save money in the long run.

Good thought on question six with blueskying!

On number eight, is there a risk of notifying the customer *too soon*?  It
might be a question to explore...

Good discussion on branching, and thanks for the enlightenment on Godot!


Great work on this one.
