      synopsis:   Cosmonarium ~ 2D game pixel art using Godot Engine
=====================================================================================
Sorry for the delay on this evaluation.  I looked back and found that you had
not submitted this document by the due date, so I logged that in my sheet,
then promptly forgot about it....  *blush*

Anyhow, nice work on this document!  I like that you have given an excellent
overview description of the game and technologies used.  The diagram shows
very well how the parts interact and fit together with the Godot engine.
The CSCI breakdown is excellent, although it might benefit from a very brief
description of each part [VERY brief, since there are so many parts].

Your functional requirements have the proper level of detail, and you have
used the "should" and "will" statements effectively, although there are one
or two places where a "shall" sneaked in there...  *grin*  Your requirements
are detailed enough to actually start designing from, which is something I
don't usually see in even industry first draft SRS's.  GOOD WORK!

This is just an awesome job and you have nothing else to do on this document
for full credit on both submissions.

GREAT WORK!
