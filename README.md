# Cosmonarium

Built primarily in the Godot Engine, Cosmonarium is a 2D RPG with a retro art style reminiscent of classic 1990s JRPGS (i.e. EarthBound and Final Fantasy). This game was designed and developed as an undergraduate capstone project at Loyola Marymount University, beginning in September 2020.

## Our Story Begins...

Somewhere in the vastness of outer space, a lonely museum sits atop an asteroid, drifting through space during the final days of the known universe. Many of the universe's surviving life forms remain preserved within this museum's halls, anaesthetized while experiencing simulations of their past lives and unaware of their imminent demise. One day, a young boy awakens from his artificially induced stupor and comes face-to-face with his seemingly hopeless plight. Along with a diverse cast of characters, he must uncover why the other exhibits have also begun to reawaken, confront the strange parasitic threat ravaging them, and find hope amidst the growing darkness.
