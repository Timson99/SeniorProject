Another great effort on this deliverable!

Your description is, of course, excellent.  I love the screen views at the
start which show the coders a lot of detail of what is intended.  Your other
diagrams at the end are also VERY useful.  Good for you for finding out how
to do UML diagrams!  They look great.  You have handled the "manager" and
"sequencer" parts very well.

Another outstanding document from Team Triumverate!!  EXCELLENT!!
